# Simple Blazor webassembly frontend

This project is a basic Blazor WebAssembly frontend application. It demonstrates how to build interactive web user interfaces using C# and .NET, running entirely in the browser. The application serves as a starting point for developing modern, client-side web apps with Blazor.

## Howto

- Chekout code into local folder
- `cd test-env`
- `docker compose up --build -d`
- With a browser goto `http://localhost:8080`

Your search will be sent to a mock echo server that will reply with the HTTP data structure received.
